# Automated Water Quality Testing System

## Project Description
This project is developed for the **EC 6020 – Embedded Systems** course.
It is a portable embedded system designed to monitor water quality
parameters such as **temperature, pH, turbidity, and electrical conductivity**
using sensors and a microcontroller. The system calculates a Water Quality
Index (WQI) to indicate water potability.
